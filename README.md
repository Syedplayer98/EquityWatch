Unveiling Racial Disparities in Dallas Policing

This project focuses on analyzing the Dallas policing data to identify patterns and disparities in police encounters with different racial and ethnic groups. The data includes information on police interactions with individuals of various races, types of force used by officers, officer race and years of experience, and the location of incidents across different regions of the city.

In the analysis of the police data, it was found that out of a total of 2383 incidents, 1333 involved Black subjects, which is the highest among all races. This was followed by Hispanic subjects with 524 incidents, and White subjects with 470 incidents. The remaining incidents were distributed among American Indian, Asian, Other, and Null races, with very small numbers.

The results of my analysis indicate that there may be a bias or imbalance in the use of police force towards Black and Hispanic individuals. This is a matter of great concern and requires attention to ensure that everyone is treated equally and fairly, regardless of their race or ethnicity. Addressing these discrepancies is crucial in promoting justice and equality for all.
